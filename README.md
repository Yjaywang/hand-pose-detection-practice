# Hand pose detection 

This is my first object detection practice project, the final model will be used by my video conferece website project (Meeting).

In this practice, some goals need to be achieved for application:
* Light-weighted
* Low computation cunsumption
* Acceptable accuracy

Based on these requirements, I choose MobileNet-SSD to train the model.
